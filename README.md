# Biquadris
This project is a variation on the hit game Tetris, created for the F24 section of CS 246, offered at the University of Waterloo. It is a two-player version, without the time-based drop present in normal Tetris. However, it includes special abilities that allow players to attack each other.

The project is built entirely using C++, using object-oriented programming principles (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance,
polymorphism). Also used are popular design patterns, such as the Decorator and Observer design patterns, which are used to implement
special abilities and the user interfaces, respectively. The Factory method pattern is used to create blocks of specific levels, of
which each level has its own unique properties that affect gameplay.

Due to the University's Academic Integrity policies, the code cannot be made publically available. However, it can be provided upon request.
Please email j6gui@uwaterloo.ca to request access to the source code.
